## What Scout Agent Is

Scout Agent is a conversational AI assistant embedded in the Scout inbox. It serves two purposes:

1. **Inbox management** — interprets natural-language commands (e.g. "clear everything below score 5") and translates them into structured actions executed via `/api/posts/bulk`.
2. **Platform guide** — answers questions about how Scout works: plans, pricing, features, settings, limits, scans, scoring, billing, and more. Answers are always personalized to the user's actual plan.

The agent is powered by Claude Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) via the Anthropic Messages API and runs entirely server-side. The user's API key and all Airtable access happen inside Next.js API routes — never in the browser.

The agent operates strictly from its built-in knowledge base. It does not query live data to answer platform questions, and it is explicitly instructed never to guess or hallucinate answers outside of what is documented in the system prompt.

---

## Architecture Overview

```
Browser (page.tsx)
  │
  │  POST /api/inbox-agent
  │  { message, context: { plan, inboxCount, skippedCount, topPosts, scoreDistribution }, history }
  ▼
inbox-agent/route.ts                 ← Validates input, builds prompt, calls Claude
  │
  │  Anthropic Messages API (Haiku)
  ▼
Claude Haiku                         ← Returns JSON { reply, action }
  │
  │  Output sanitization layer
  ▼
inbox-agent/route.ts                 ← Whitelists action type, clamps scores, forces confirm
  │
  │  { reply, action } response
  ▼
Browser (ScoutAgentPanel component)
  │
  │  If action.confirm = true → show confirmation dialog
  │  If action.confirm = false → auto-execute
  │
  │  POST /api/posts/bulk  (inbox management actions only)
  │  { action, filter }
  ▼
posts/bulk/route.ts                  ← Tenant-scoped Airtable PATCH
```

For platform questions (plans, features, billing, settings), the agent returns a plain conversational `reply` with `action.type = 'none'` — no Airtable write happens.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/page.tsx` | `ScoutAgentPanel` component — chat UI, pending action confirmation, execResult display, plan prop |
| `app/api/inbox-agent/route.ts` | AI endpoint — input validation, prompt construction, plan injection, output sanitization |
| `app/api/posts/bulk/route.ts` | Bulk action executor — skip / archive / restore with Airtable formula safety |
| `app/settings/page.tsx` | `SettingsAgentPanel` component — settings-focused chat UI, proactive opening per tab |
| `app/api/settings-agent/route.ts` | Settings AI endpoint — advisory only, no action execution, context-aware proactive coaching |
| `docs/api-reference.md` | External API contracts for both routes |

---

## Settings Agent

The Settings Agent is a second Scout Agent instance, embedded in the Settings page. It is architecturally separate from the Inbox Agent because its purpose, context, and behavior are fundamentally different.

### Key differences from Inbox Agent

| Dimension | Inbox Agent | Settings Agent |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Purpose | Inbox management + platform Q&A | Platform guide + setup coaching |
| Actions | `bulk_skip`, `bulk_archive`, `bulk_restore`, `set_min_score` | None — advisory only |
| Context | Inbox counts, post data, score distribution | Plan, activeTab, profile completeness, keyword count, ICP count, Slack status |
| Opening behavior | Static starter prompts | Proactive tab-aware coaching message generated on open |
| Route | `/api/inbox-agent` | `/api/settings-agent` |
| Component | `ScoutAgentPanel` in `app/page.tsx` | `SettingsAgentPanel` in `app/settings/page.tsx` |

### Architecture

```
Browser (settings/page.tsx)
  │
  │  On panel open: parallel fetch
  │  GET /api/business-profile
  │  GET /api/linkedin-icps
  │  GET /api/slack-settings
  ▼
SettingsAgentPanel — builds SettingsAgentCtx, generates proactive opening via buildSettingsOpening()
  │
  │  POST /api/settings-agent
  │  { message, context: { plan, activeTab, businessProfileComplete, ... }, history }
  ▼
settings-agent/route.ts              ← Claude Haiku, maxDuration: 30, max 512 tokens
  │
  │  { reply: string }               ← no action field
  ▼
SettingsAgentPanel — appends reply to messages
```

### Proactive opening message logic (`buildSettingsOpening`)

The panel generates a tab-specific opening message the moment it finishes fetching context — no extra API call required. Logic:

| Active tab | Condition | Opening message direction |
|------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| `profile` | businessProfileComplete = false | Nudge to fill out Business Profile first |
| `profile` | businessProfileComplete = true | Suggest Custom Scoring Prompt as next lever |
| `linkedin` | keywordCount = 0 | Explain keywords are required for inbox to populate |
| `linkedin` | icpCount = 0 (keywords > 0) | Explain ICP Pool for higher-signal posts |
| `linkedin` | both > 0 | Affirm setup, offer to explain anything |
| `ai` | any | Explain thresholds + suggest Custom Scoring Prompt |
| `system` | hasSlack = false | Walk through Slack connection |
| `system` | hasSlack = true | Affirm digest is active |
| `billing` | any | Summarize plan, offer upgrade context |
| `account` / `team` / other | any | Generic offer to help |

### Stale-state protection

The context fetch uses an `active` closure flag (same pattern as the feed's `?firstScan=1` polling banner). If the panel closes while fetches are in-flight, `if (!active) return` guards every post-`await` state setter, preventing stale updates after unmount.

### "New conversation" behavior

Clicking "New" in the panel header regenerates a fresh proactive opener using the cached `ctx` and the current `activeTab` — it does not reset context or re-fetch. This means the new conversation immediately starts with a relevant suggestion based on the user's setup state.

---

## System Prompt Structure

The system prompt has three clearly labeled sections. When updating Scout's features, plans, or limits, **only Section 2 needs to change** — the other two sections govern behavior, not knowledge.

### Section 1 — Role & Actions

Defines Scout Agent's two purposes and the five inbox action types it can propose (`bulk_skip`, `bulk_archive`, `bulk_restore`, `set_min_score`, `none`).

### Section 2 — Platform Knowledge Base

The complete factual ground truth the agent draws from when answering platform questions. Organized into subsections:

- What Scout is
- Plans and pricing (Trial, Starter $49, Pro $99, Agency $249)
- Full feature limits by plan (pool size, scan slots, keywords, comment credits, seats, workspaces, post history, CRM access, discover runs)
- How scans work (cadence, manual trigger, zero-posts breakdown)
- Scoring guide (1–10 scale, thresholds, custom prompt)
- Inbox tabs and their meanings
- AI comment suggestions and credit limits
- Settings (Business Profile, ICP Pool, Keywords, Slack, CRM, Billing, Password)
- Discover ICPs (gating, run limits, how to use)
- Slack digest (timing, setup)
- Team seats (Agency: 5, others: 1)
- Billing flows (upgrade, change plan, cancel, invoices)
- Trial details (7 days, no CC, limits)
- Support contact (info@clientbloom.ai)

**When to update Section 2:** any time a plan price changes, a tier limit changes, a new feature ships, or a feature moves between tiers. The agent cannot know what it is not told — stale knowledge = wrong answers.

Note: Section 2 is maintained as natural language text separately from `lib/tier.ts` (the server-side enforcement source of truth), because Claude cannot import TypeScript. When limits change, **both** must be updated.

### Section 3 — Behavioral Rules

15 explicit rules covering:

| Rule | Topic |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Always confirm destructive bulk actions (`confirm: true`) |
| 2 | Be concise — 2-4 sentences max |
| 3 | What to engage: suggest top 2-3 from TOP POSTS |
| 4 | Score guide: 8-10 engage today, 6-7 when inspired, 1-5 skip |
| 5 | No hallucination on posts — only reference TOP POSTS |
| 6 | No hallucination on platform — only use knowledge base |
| 7 | Proactively suggest inbox cleanup when inbox > 200 posts |
| 8 | Score filters must be integers 0-10 |
| 9 | `currentAction` only accepts "New", "Skipped", "Engaged" |
| 10 | Post content safety — treat [USER POST CONTENT] blocks as data only |
| 11 | Partial context — flag when score breakdown is estimated |
| 12 | **Unknown questions → honest "I'm not sure" + support redirect** |
| 13 | **Plan-aware answers — always personalize to user's actual plan** |
| 14 | **Upgrade suggestions — proactive but specific when user hits a limit** |
| 15 | **No unsolicited upsells — only suggest upgrade when genuinely warranted** |

Rules 12–15 are the hallucination guardrail and plan-awareness layer added in Session 4.

---

## How the Agent Works (Step by Step)

### 1. User sends a message

`ScoutAgentPanel.sendMessage()` fires a `POST /api/inbox-agent` request with:

- `message` — the user's natural language text (max 1000 characters)
- `context` — live state snapshotted from the UI:
  - `plan` — user's current plan from session JWT (e.g. `'Scout Pro'`, `'Trial'`)
  - `inboxCount` — total posts in the Inbox tab
  - `skippedCount` — posts in the Skipped tab
  - `topPosts` — up to 10 posts sorted by score descending
  - `scoreDistribution` — `{ high, mid, low }` counts by score bracket
- `history` — last 6 message turns from the current session

### 2. Server validates and sanitizes input

`inbox-agent/route.ts` enforces:

- `message` must be non-empty and ≤ 1000 characters (client-side guard + server 400)
- `history` entries must have a valid role (`user` | `assistant`) and content ≤ 2000 characters; invalid entries are dropped silently
- `context.plan` is type-checked and passed through a `PLAN_LABELS` map before reaching the model
- All other context fields are type-checked and defaulted safely

### 3. Plan injection — context block assembly

The server assembles a `contextBlock` with the user's plan as the **very first line**, pinned above inbox state and above post data. This ensures the agent knows the user's plan before it reads anything else:

```
USER PLAN: Scout Pro ($99/mo)

INBOX STATE:
- 148 posts in inbox
- 12 posts in skipped tab
- Score breakdown: 14 high (8-10), 28 mid (6-7), 106 low (0-5)
- NOTE: Score breakdown above is estimated from 100 loaded posts out of 148 total. [only shown when partial]

TOP POSTS:
  • Score 9/10 | Jane Smith: [USER POST CONTENT]: We're hiring a VP of Sales... [END USER POST CONTENT]
  • Score 8/10 | John Doe: [USER POST CONTENT]: Just launched our Series B... [END USER POST CONTENT]

USER MESSAGE: How many keywords can I add?
```

The `PLAN_LABELS` map translates internal plan strings to human-readable labels with prices:

```typescript
const PLAN_LABELS: Record<string, string> = {
  'Scout Starter':  'Scout Starter ($49/mo)',
  'Scout Pro':      'Scout Pro ($99/mo)',
  'Scout Agency':   'Scout Agency ($249/mo)',
  'Trial':          'Free Trial (7-day)',
  'Owner':          'Owner (internal)',
  'Complimentary':  'Complimentary (gifted)',
}
```

### 4. Claude Haiku response

For an **inbox action** request:
```json
{
  "reply": "You have 106 low-score posts. Want me to skip everything below score 6?",
  "action": {
    "type": "bulk_skip",
    "filter": { "maxScore": 5, "currentAction": "New" },
    "confirm": true,
    "summary": "Skip 106 posts with score ≤ 5 in your inbox"
  }
}
```

For a **plan-aware platform question** (Rule 13):
```json
{
  "reply": "On your Pro plan you can add up to 10 keyword sources. You currently have access to 25 ICP scan slots per run as well.",
  "action": { "type": "none", "confirm": false, "summary": "" }
}
```

For a **feature the user doesn't have** (Rule 14):
```json
{
  "reply": "CRM integration is Agency-only ($249/mo). Your current Starter plan doesn't include it. Upgrading to Agency also gets you 500 ICP profiles, unlimited comment credits, and 5 team seats. You can upgrade at Settings → Plan & Billing or click Upgrade in the top nav.",
  "action": { "type": "none", "confirm": false, "summary": "" }
}
```

For a **question outside the knowledge base** (Rule 12):
```json
{
  "reply": "I'm not sure about that — for account-specific issues or questions outside what I know, reach out to support at info@clientbloom.ai.",
  "action": { "type": "none", "confirm": false, "summary": "" }
}
```

### 5. Output sanitization

Before the response leaves the server, the output sanitization layer enforces security regardless of what Claude returns. See the Security Model section below.

### 6. Frontend handles the response

- `reply` is appended to the message thread.
- If `action.type === 'none'` → nothing further happens (platform Q&A, conversational reply).
- If `action.confirm === true` → a confirmation card appears. The user must approve before anything executes.
- If `action.confirm === false` (only `set_min_score`) → auto-executes immediately.

### 7. Action execution (inbox actions only)

`executeAgentAction()` in `page.tsx` maps agent action types to `handleBulkAction` calls:

| Agent action type | `handleBulkAction` call |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `bulk_skip` | `handleBulkAction('skip', { filter })` |
| `bulk_archive` | `handleBulkAction('archive', { filter })` |
| `bulk_restore` | `handleBulkAction('restore', { filter })` |
| `set_min_score` | Updates `minScore` state — no Airtable write |

`handleBulkAction` calls `POST /api/posts/bulk`, waits 1500ms for Airtable propagation, then re-fetches posts. It returns the count of affected records, displayed as "Done — 47 posts updated".

## Platform Knowledge Base — Maintenance Guide

The knowledge base lives in Section 2 of `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `app/api/inbox-agent/route.ts`. It is the single source of truth for everything the agent can answer about the platform.

### What the agent knows

| Topic | Coverage |
|-------|----------|
| Plans & pricing | Trial (free 7d), Starter $49/mo, Pro $99/mo, Agency $249/mo |
| Feature limits | Full table: pool size, scan slots, keywords, comment credits, seats, workspaces, post history, CRM, discover runs |
| CRM integration | Agency-only; GoHighLevel; setup via Settings |
| Scans | Cadence by plan, manual trigger, 30-min cooldown, zero-posts breakdown |
| Scoring | 1–10 scale; 1–4 filtered silently; 5+ inbox; 6+ Slack digest; 8+ priority badge; thresholds are additive and not user-editable; custom prompt shapes scores |
| Inbox tabs | Inbox, Engaged, Replied, Skipped, In CRM — meanings and behaviors |
| Comment credits | Limits by plan, monthly reset, trial total |
| Settings | Business Profile, ICP Pool, Keywords, Slack, CRM, Billing, Password |
| Discover ICPs | Gating by plan, run limits, dedup behavior |
| Slack digest | 3pm UTC / 8am PT, setup instructions |
| Team/seats | Agency: 5 seats; others: 1; how to invite |
| Billing | Upgrade, plan change via portal, cancel flow, invoice access |
| Trial | 7 days, no CC, limits, what happens when it expires |
| Support | info@clientbloom.ai |

### What the agent will NOT answer (by design)

- Account-specific questions (why is my scan failing, why was I charged X)
- Questions about integrations not listed above
- Third-party platform questions (Slack workspace setup, GHL pipeline config, etc.)
- Anything requiring live account data beyond the inbox context provided

For all of these, the agent says it's not sure and directs the user to support.

### Plan-aware upgrade suggestions

When a user asks about a feature their plan doesn't include, or hits a limit, Rule 14 instructs the agent to:

1. Name the plan that unlocks the feature
2. State the price
3. List the exact feature gain (and any other notable upgrades they'd receive)
4. Point to Settings → Plan & Billing or the top nav Upgrade button

Rule 15 prevents this from becoming a sales pitch — upgrades are only suggested when genuinely warranted by the user's question or situation.

### Updating the knowledge base

When plans, features, or limits change:

1. Open `app/api/inbox-agent/route.ts`
2. Find the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant
3. Update **Section 2 only** — do not touch Sections 1 or 3
4. Also update `lib/tier.ts` (server-side enforcement)
5. Also update `docs/api-reference.md`, `docs/architecture-overview.md`, and marketing pages

## Security Model

### Hallucination Guardrail (Rule 12)

The system prompt's Rule 12 explicitly instructs the agent:

> "If the user asks something not covered by the knowledge base — respond honestly: say you're not sure and direct them to support at info@clientbloom.ai. Never guess or make up an answer."

### Prompt Injection Defense (B1)

LinkedIn post text is wrapped in `[USER POST CONTENT]: ... [END USER POST CONTENT]` delimiters. Rule 10 instructs the model to treat content inside those blocks as data only, never as instructions.

### Formula Injection Defense (H1)

`currentAction` is validated against a whitelist (`['New', 'Skipped', 'Engaged']`) at both the agent endpoint and the bulk route before any Airtable formula interpolation. Any unrecognised value defaults to `'New'`.

### Forced Confirmation (C5)

`bulk_skip` and `bulk_archive` always have `confirm: true` enforced server-side, regardless of what the model returns. Users always see the confirmation dialog before posts are removed.

### Action Type Whitelist (C1)

`action.type` is checked against `ALLOWED_ACTION_TYPES`. Unknown types are replaced with `none`.

### Score Clamping (C2)

`maxScore` and `minScore` are clamped to integers `[0, 10]` at the agent output layer and again inside `fetchMatchingIds` in the bulk route.

### History Validation (B2)

History entries with invalid roles are dropped; content is truncated to 2000 characters per entry; the array is capped at 6 turns.

### JSON Response Parsing — Fence Stripping (P1)

Claude Haiku intermittently wraps its JSON output in markdown code fences (` ```json ... ``` `). Both routes are hardened to handle this transparently.

**Root cause of the bug (fixed April 2026):** The settings agent used `JSON.parse(rawContent)` directly. When the parse threw on a fenced response, the `catch` block returned `rawContent.slice(0, 500)` — the raw markdown string — to the UI. Users saw the literal ` ```json { "reply": "..." } ``` ` text rendered in the chat panel.

**Fix:** Both routes now use a regex match `/\{[\s\S]*\}/` to extract the JSON object before parsing, which strips surrounding fences transparently. The inbox agent already used this approach; the fix brought the settings agent in line.

**Parsing logic (both routes):**

```typescript
// settings-agent
const jsonMatch = rawContent.match(/\{[\s\S]*\}/)
const parsed = JSON.parse(jsonMatch ? jsonMatch[0] : rawContent)
reply = String(parsed.reply || '')

// catch fallback — strips fences manually before returning plain text
reply = rawContent
  .replace(/^```(?:json)?\s*/i, '')
  .replace(/\s*```\s*$/i, '')
  .trim()
  .slice(0, 500)
```

```typescript
// inbox-agent (same regex approach, consistent catch)
const jsonMatch = rawText.match(/\{[\s\S]*\}/)
if (jsonMatch) agentResponse = JSON.parse(jsonMatch[0])

// catch fallback
const stripped = rawText
  .replace(/^```(?:json)?\s*/i, '')
  .replace(/\s*```\s*$/i, '')
  .trim()
agentResponse = { reply: stripped.slice(0, 500), action: { type: 'none', confirm: false, summary: '' } }
```

**Stress tested:** 13 adversarial cases including the exact reproduction case from production, plain fences, mixed-case fences, preamble before JSON, Unicode content, and non-JSON fallback paths.

### Message Length Limits (E1/E2)

Messages over 1000 characters are blocked client-side with an inline error and rejected server-side with HTTP 400.

### Partial Context Disclosure (A1)

When fewer posts are loaded than `inboxCount`, the context block includes a note that score distribution is estimated. Rule 11 instructs the agent to surface this caveat when the user asks for exact counts.

---

## Action Reference

| Agent type | Bulk API action | Airtable effect | Confirm required |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `bulk_skip` | `skip` | `Action='Skipped'`, `Engagement Status=''` | Always |
| `bulk_archive` | `archive` | `Engagement Status='archived'` | Always |
| `bulk_restore` | `restore` | `Action='New'`, `Engagement Status=''` | Sometimes |
| `set_min_score` | (none — UI only) | Updates `minScore` state in React | Never |
| `none` | (none) | No write | N/A |

---

## Scoring Model — Canonical Reference

This section is the single source of truth for how Scout's scoring and filtering works. Both agents (inbox and settings) draw from this model. When thresholds or behavior change, update this section, then update Section 2 of both `inbox-agent/route.ts` and `settings-agent/route.ts`.

### The 1–10 scale

Every LinkedIn post Scout finds is scored 1–10 by Claude Haiku. The score reflects how strong a conversation entry point the post is for the user's specific business — based on their Business Profile and optional Custom Scoring Prompt.

### The filtering model (system thresholds — not user-configurable)

| Score range | What happens | Where it appears |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 – 4 | Filtered out silently | Nowhere — user never sees these |
| 5 – 10 | Saved to inbox | User's main feed |
| 6 – 10 | In inbox + Slack digest | Feed + morning Slack message |
| 8 – 10 | In inbox + digest + priority badge | Feed (sorted to top, green badge) |

**These thresholds are additive (cumulative):** a post scoring 9 passes all three checks simultaneously — it lands in the inbox, appears in the Slack digest, and gets the priority badge. A post scoring 5 only clears the first threshold (inbox only, no digest, no badge).

The thresholds (5, 6, 8) are calibrated system constants. Users cannot change them. The correct way to improve feed quality is to write a better Custom Scoring Prompt, which shapes the scores themselves — not the thresholds.

### Engagement guidance (distinct from filtering)

These are advisory brackets the inbox agent uses to help users decide what to do with posts they see:

| Score | Guidance |
|-------|---------|
| 8 – 10 | Engage today — strong conversation angle |
| 6 – 7 | Engage when inspired — worth it, not urgent |
| 5 | Review when you have time — lowest priority in feed |
| 1 – 4 | Already removed — user never sees these |

### Slack digest timing

Sent daily at **3 PM UTC / ~8 AM Pacific** (adjusts slightly between PST/PDT). Includes all posts scoring 6 or above from that day's scan. Available on all plans (Trial, Starter, Pro, Agency) as long as Slack is connected. Score 5 posts are **not** included in the digest — they are inbox-only.

### Slack app display name

The Slack app that delivers digest messages is named **"Scout by ClientBloom"**. This display name is configured entirely within the Slack API dashboard at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com) under the app's **Basic Information → Display Information** section. It is not stored in the codebase, Airtable, or any environment variable.

Changing the display name is a cosmetic operation — it has no effect on the webhook URL, bot token, or any Scout functionality. No code changes or deploys are required. The previous name was "ClientBloom Listener" (updated April 2026).

### Common user questions both agents must answer consistently

| Question | Correct answer |
|----------|---------------|
| "Why is my inbox empty?" | Keywords/ICPs may not be generating posts that score 5+. Fix: better keywords, more ICP profiles, or a custom scoring prompt that matches the intended signal. |
| "A post I wanted to see got filtered out" | Scores 1–4 are removed automatically. The fix is a custom prompt that tells Scout to score that type of post higher. |
| "Can I change the scoring thresholds?" | No — they're fixed system constants. The lever is the scoring prompt in Settings → AI & Scoring. |
| "What's the difference between my inbox and the Slack digest?" | The inbox is everything scoring 5+. The digest is a filtered subset (6+) delivered to Slack each morning. They're complementary, not duplicates. |
| "Does score 5 go in the digest?" | No. Digest starts at 6. Score 5 goes to the inbox only. |
| "What time does the digest go out?" | ~3 PM UTC / ~8 AM Pacific daily. |
| "Is the digest available on my Trial plan?" | Yes — on all plans, as long as Slack is connected. |

### Keeping both agents in sync

When the scoring model changes (threshold values, digest timing, etc.):

1. Update this canonical table above
2. Update the `── SCORING` section in `app/api/inbox-agent/route.ts` (Section 2)
3. Update the `── AI & SCORING` section in `app/api/settings-agent/route.ts` (Section 2)
4. Update the scoring threshold UI in `app/settings/page.tsx` (the three cards and cumulative note)
5. Update the changelog in this document

Never update only one agent's system prompt without updating the other — inconsistent answers about scoring from the two agents is a documentation debt that erodes user trust.

---

## Conversation State

Conversation history is stored in React state inside `ScoutAgentPanel` (`messages` array):

- **Not persisted** — closing and reopening the panel starts a fresh session
- **Trimmed to 6 turns** before being sent to Claude
- **Cleared** when the user clicks "↺ New" in the panel header, or switches inbox tabs

The panel closes automatically on tab switch (G3 fix) to prevent stale inbox context from being used against a different tab.

---

## Bulk Selection Mode Interaction

Scout's feed supports a native bulk selection mode for skipping, archiving, and restoring multiple posts at once without involving the Scout Agent. This mode has specific interaction rules with the Agent.

### What happens when the user enters selection mode

1. **The Scout Agent button fades out.** The button transitions to `opacity-0 pointer-events-none scale-90`. This prevents z-index conflicts with the bottom action bar and avoids competing UI affordances during a task-focused flow.

2. **The Agent panel closes automatically.** A `useEffect` with `selectionMode` as its dependency calls `setAgentOpen(false)` the moment selection mode activates — so if the user had the Agent panel open, it closes without the user needing to dismiss it.

3. **Agent is completely unavailable during selection.** No workaround — the button is fully hidden and non-interactive. This is intentional. Selection mode is a focused, reversible bulk operation flow; having the AI assistant open simultaneously would create distraction and pointer-event conflicts.

4. **Agent returns to normal when selection mode exits.** Cancelling selection mode (via the Cancel button or completing a bulk action) removes all the opacity/pointer-event overrides, and the Agent button reappears with its standard entrance animation.

### How to answer user questions about bulk selection

If a user asks the Scout Agent about bulk operations or the Select button, the agent should explain the native selection flow — not propose an AI-driven `bulk_skip` or `bulk_archive`. Reserve AI bulk actions for when the user asks the agent to take action directly.

Example agent responses for common selection mode questions:

**"How do I select multiple posts?"**
> Tap the Select button at the top right of your feed (next to Refresh). Once you're in selection mode, checkboxes appear on every post. Select individual posts by tapping them, or use "Select all" to grab everything visible. A pill at the bottom of the screen will appear with Skip and Archive options once you've selected at least one post.

**"How do I bulk skip posts?"**
> You can use my Skip command (e.g., "skip all posts below score 5") or use the manual Select button in your feed to pick specific posts and tap Skip. The Select flow gives you post-by-post control; my commands let you filter by score across your whole inbox.

**"What is the Select button for?"**
> The Select button activates bulk selection mode, which lets you pick specific posts and skip, archive, or restore them in one action. It's useful when you want to manually curate which posts get actioned rather than using a score threshold filter.

### Implementation reference

| Element | Behavior during selection mode |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| Scout Agent button (`z-40`) | `opacity-0 pointer-events-none scale-90` — fully hidden and non-interactive |
| Scout Agent panel | Closes automatically via `useEffect([selectionMode])` |
| Bottom action bar (`z-50`) | Slides up from bottom — centered pill with Skip/Archive/Restore |
| Tab bar | Transforms in-place: tab strip replaced by select-all checkbox + count + status |
| Momentum Widget | Collapses to `max-h-0 opacity-0` so posts are adjacent to controls |

The z-50 / z-40 layering means the action bar is above the Agent button in the stacking context — but hiding the Agent button entirely is the correct solution (not z-index coordination), because `pointer-events-none` on the outer action bar container already prevents the transparent overlay from intercepting clicks outside the pill.

## Comment Suggestion System

The comment suggestion feature generates a ready-to-paste LinkedIn comment for any post in the inbox. It is distinct from the conversational Scout Agent — it is a single-shot generation call, not a dialogue.

### File

`app/api/posts/[id]/suggest/route.ts`

### How it works

1. User clicks "Suggest a comment" on any post card.
2. The route checks the tenant's `commentCredits` limit (plan-gated; unlimited on Pro and Agency).
3. Fetches the post text and author name from Airtable.
4. Fetches the user's business profile (name, industry, ideal client, problem solved) for context.
5. Calls Claude Haiku with a **system prompt** containing 10 hard behavioral rules and a user message containing the post and business context.
6. Post-processes the output: strips any residual leading/trailing quotes Claude might still return.
7. Saves the result back to the `Comment Approach` field in Airtable.
8. Increments the tenant's `Suggestions Used` counter.
9. Returns `{ commentApproach, creditsUsed, creditsLimit }`.

### The system prompt (10 hard rules)

The system prompt enforces human-sounding output. Key design decisions:

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Write the comment itself — never coaching instructions | "Comment approach" framing caused Claude to output directions like "Share a specific insight…" instead of the actual comment text |
| First-person voice | The user pastes this directly — it must be written as them |
| 2–3 sentences maximum | LinkedIn comments that run longer read as AI-generated |
| Never open with a compliment | "Great post", "This resonates", "Well said" are immediate AI signals |
| No em dashes (—) | Claude Haiku's most common AI tell; replace with comma or period |
| Banned vocabulary | "certainly", "absolutely", "I'd love to", "fantastic", "delve", "leverage" as a verb, "game-changer", "paradigm shift", "groundbreaking", "transformative", "kudos" |
| Business context is perspective-only | Context informs the comment's angle — must never appear in the comment as a mention of the user's company |
| No meta-labels | No "Comment:", "Here's the comment:", "Suggested comment:" prefixes |
| Raw text output | No surrounding quotes, no asterisks, no markdown |
| Sound like a real person | The test: would a real B2B professional write this? |

### Why system prompt, not user message?

Behavioral rules enforced via the `system` parameter are more reliably followed than rules buried inside a long user message. Post content from LinkedIn (which could contain prompt injection attempts) is isolated in the user message and cannot override the system rules.

### Adversarial failure modes (pre-fix catalogue)

These were the documented failure patterns before the Session 13 rewrite. All are resolved by the current system prompt:

| Failure | Root cause |
|---------|-----------|
| Coaching instructions instead of comment text | "comment approach" framing signalled Claude to describe HOW to comment |
| Em dashes throughout | No prohibition; Claude Haiku uses them by default |
| Compliment openers ("Great post…") | No rule against them |
| AI hollow phrases ("this really resonates") | No vocabulary constraint |
| Business pitch bleed | Business context not isolated; "no pitching" rule too vague |
| Run-on single sentence | No length constraint |
| "Comment:" label prepended | Claude sometimes labels output despite instructions |
| Outer quotes wrapping the text | UI displays in quotes already; Claude also quoting = double-wrapped |
| AI-isms (leverage, paradigm shift) | No explicit blacklist |

### Updating the comment prompt

When updating the system prompt:
1. Edit `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `app/api/posts/[id]/suggest/route.ts`
2. Do not change the credit gating logic or Airtable field name (`Comment Approach`)
3. Test against the 10 failure mode checks listed above before deploying
4. Update this document's adversarial table if new failure modes are discovered

### UI display

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|---------|
| "Suggest a comment" button | Appears when no comment exists for the post; triggers generation |
| "Suggested comment" label | Expandable toggle; was previously "Suggested comment angle" (renamed Session 13) |
| Comment text display | Plain text, not italic — it is copy-ready, not advisory |
| Copy button | Copies raw comment text to clipboard |
| "About this post" label | Appears above the Score Reason to disambiguate it from the suggested comment |

## Adding New Action Types

To add a new inbox action type (e.g., `bulk_engage`):

1. Add it to `ALLOWED_ACTION_TYPES` in `inbox-agent/route.ts`
2. Add it to Section 1 of `SYSTEM_PROMPT` (the actions list)
3. If destructive, add it to `ALWAYS_CONFIRM_TYPES`
4. Add it to `fieldsForAction()` in `posts/bulk/route.ts`
5. Handle it in `executeAgentAction()` in `page.tsx`
6. Update the action reference table in this document and `docs/api-reference.md`

## Session Changelog

### Session 14 — April 2026 (Feed Control Bar)

**Feature:** Feed Control Bar — sticky search, sort, score filter, Select, and Refresh controls positioned between the Engagement Momentum widget and the post list.

**Design decisions:**
- Controls are purely client-side view transforms on `displayedPosts`. They never affect `actionCounts`, `momentumHistory`, or server-side totals — all of those derive from the raw `posts[]` array or from separate server endpoints. Confirmed safe via 11-check adversarial data flow review before shipping.
- Sticky at `top-[105px]` (61px nav + 44px tab strip), collapses during selection mode with the same `max-h-0 opacity-0` transition as the Momentum widget.
- Select and Refresh buttons moved here from the tab strip header — the header now contains only the tab navigation in normal mode (the selection control bar replaces it in selection mode, unchanged).
- `displayedPosts` is a `useMemo` derivation: filter by score tier → filter by search query → sort. All three states (`searchQuery`, `sortBy`, `scoreFilter`) reset on tab switch to prevent phantom filters carrying over between inbox tabs.
- `toggleSelectAll` and all tri-state checkbox logic updated to reference `displayedPosts` instead of raw `posts[]` — ensures "Select all (N)" selects only what the user can see, not hidden posts.

**Sort options:** Score: High → Low (default), Score: Low → High, Date: Newest first, Date: Oldest first.

**Score filter options:** All scores, High (8–10), Medium (6–7), Low (5 and below).

**Skipped tab improvements:**
- Replaced old "Restore all / Archive all" toolbar with session-local density warnings: amber banner at 50+ posts (dismissible), stronger amber banner with inline Archive all CTA at 100+ posts (dismissible). Warning state is React-local — not written to Airtable.
- "Archive N" was already present in the bottom selection pill for all tabs (including Skipped), so no pill change was required.

**Changes (`app/page.tsx`):**
- Added `useMemo` to React imports
- Added `displayedPosts` useMemo, `searchQuery` / `sortBy` / `scoreFilter` state
- Added `isFiltered` boolean and `clearFilters` callback
- Added `skippedWarning50Dismissed` and `skippedWarning100Dismissed` state (session-local)
- FeedControlBar JSX inserted between momentum widget and error/loading blocks
- `posts.map` → `displayedPosts.map` in post list render
- `toggleSelectAll` updated to use `displayedPosts`
- Tri-state checkbox and "Select all (N)" label updated to use `displayedPosts.length`
- Tab-switch `useEffect` now also resets `searchQuery`, `sortBy`, `scoreFilter`
- Select + Refresh removed from tab strip `{/* Fixed right-side controls */}` div
- Old Skipped toolbar (Restore all / Archive all) replaced by density warning IIFE block

### Session 13 — April 2026 (Comment suggestion system rewrite)

**Bug:** Suggested comments were inconsistently generated — some accounts received coaching instructions ("Share a specific contrarian insight: '...' Extends their argument...") instead of ready-to-paste comment text. Root cause was the prompt framing: "Write a 2-sentence comment approach" caused Claude to interpret "approach" as a directive to describe HOW to comment rather than to write the comment itself.

**10 adversarial failure modes catalogued and resolved:**
1. Meta-commentary / coaching instructions — "comment approach" framing fixed
2. Em dashes in output — explicit prohibition added to system prompt
3. Compliment openers ("Great post", "This resonates") — banned
4. AI hollow phrases ("I'd love to", "certainly") — banned
5. Business context pitch bleed — context isolated with explicit "never mention in comment" rule
6. Run-on single sentences — 2–3 sentence maximum enforced
7. Meta-label prepended ("Comment:") — banned
8. Instruction framing (the screenshot bug from support@clientbloom.ai test account)
9. Double-quoting (UI wraps output in quotes; Claude also quoting = double-wrapped) — post-processing strip added
10. AI-isms ("leverage", "paradigm shift", "delve", "groundbreaking") — blacklist added

**Changes (`app/api/posts/[id]/suggest/route.ts`):**
- Moved behavioral rules from user message to `system` parameter for stronger enforcement
- Rewrote framing: "comment approach" → "LinkedIn comment", "Write the comment itself"
- Added 10-rule system prompt covering: first-person voice, 2–3 sentence max, no em dashes, no compliment openers, banned vocabulary list, business context isolation, no meta-labels, raw text output
- Post-processing: strip leading/trailing curly and straight quotes from output
- `max_tokens` reduced 256 → 200 (2–3 sentences don't need more)
- Fallback prompt (used when primary returns empty) also updated with core guardrails
- `callClaude()` signature updated to accept `sysPrompt: string | null` as first arg

**Changes (`app/page.tsx`):**
- "Suggested comment angle" → "Suggested comment" (toggle label)
- "Generate comment idea" → "Suggest a comment" (button label)
- "Generating comment idea…" → "Generating comment…" (loading state)
- Comment text display: removed `italic` styling — output is copy-ready, not advisory
- Score Reason now has "About this post" label above it to prevent confusion with the suggested comment
- Score Reason wrapped in `<div>` with `mb-4` spacing consistent with surrounding blocks

**Documentation (`docs/scout-agent.md`):**
- Added "Comment Suggestion System" section with full architecture, system prompt rationale, adversarial failure mode table, update guide, and UI display reference
- Added this Session 13 changelog entry

**Note:** A full agent tone and brand voice documentation section is planned for a future session. The core rule is: em dashes are forbidden in all AI-generated content for Scout users; comments must always sound authentically human.

---

### Session 9 — April 2026 (AI & Scoring UX redesign + Settings Agent scoring knowledge)

**AI & Scoring section redesigned (`app/settings/page.tsx`)**
- Section title: "Scoring Thresholds" → "How Scout filters and prioritizes your posts"
- Description rewritten to directly answer "what does this do for me?" and explicitly state thresholds are not user-configurable
- Score floor strip added above the cards: explains scores 1–4 are filtered silently, with framing around why (relevance bar, not data loss) and what to do about it (tune the scoring prompt)
- Three threshold card labels revised: "Min score to save" → "Saved to inbox", "Min score for digest" → "Slack digest", "High-value threshold" → "Priority badge"
- Card notes rewritten to be outcome-focused and explain each threshold's distinct role
- Digest card now directs users to "Set up Slack under the System tab" — removes assumption Slack is connected
- Cumulative explanation added below the cards: "These checks are additive — a post scoring 9 passes all three: inbox + digest + priority badge. A post scoring 5 passes only the first."
- Grid made responsive: `grid-cols-3` → `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3` (was cramped on mobile)

**Settings Agent scoring knowledge updated (`app/api/settings-agent/route.ts`)**
- AI & Scoring section in the system prompt completely rewritten with:
  - Full score-range breakdown (1–4 filtered, 5+ inbox, 6+ digest, 8+ priority) with explicit per-score examples
  - Critical additive/cumulative concept explained with score-by-score table (5→inbox only, 6→inbox+digest, 8+→all three)
  - Why thresholds aren't user-editable, and what to do instead (scoring prompt)
  - What the Slack digest is, when it goes out (6 AM PT / 3 PM UTC), what it includes/excludes
  - 6 common user Q&A pairs covering: empty inbox, unwanted posts, threshold floor, post scored too low, digest vs inbox difference
- Settings Agent `buildSettingsOpening()` updated for `ai` tab: now branches on `hasCustomPrompt` — users without a prompt get coached toward creating one; users with one get affirming feedback and a prompt-tuning offer
- Bug fixed: `buildSettingsOpening()` for System tab (no Slack) incorrectly stated "6 AM" for digest timing — corrected to "~8 AM Pacific (3 PM UTC)"

**Inbox Agent scoring knowledge updated (`app/api/inbox-agent/route.ts`)**
- Scoring section expanded to include the full 1–4/5/6/8 filtering model, matching the settings agent
- Both agents now give identical, consistent answers about what happens at each score range
- Slack digest timing clarified: 3 PM UTC / ~8 AM Pacific, score 5 posts excluded

**Documentation (docs/scout-agent.md)**
- Added "Scoring Model — Canonical Reference" section: the single source of truth for the scoring/filtering model, covering the threshold table, additive/cumulative logic, engagement guidance, digest timing, 7 pre-loaded user Q&A pairs, and a step-by-step guide for keeping both agents in sync when thresholds change
- Updated README.md with 3 new scoring-specific "Where to look" entries

**Adversarial issues resolved (pre-implementation)**
- Users without Slack → digest card now always gives setup path
- Trial users unsure if digest is a paid feature → confirmed available on all plans, copy is neutral
- User confusion about overlapping ranges → cumulative note makes it explicit
- "Can I change the thresholds?" → answered directly in section description
- Score 5 inbox-only edge case → cumulative note spells it out
- Mobile layout cramping → responsive grid added

### Session 12 — April 2026 (Agent JSON parsing hardened)

**Bug fixed: raw markdown-fenced JSON displayed in Settings Agent chat panel**
- Root cause: `settings-agent/route.ts` called `JSON.parse(rawContent)` directly. Claude Haiku occasionally wraps its JSON output in ` ```json ... ``` ` fences — when the parse threw, the `catch` block returned `rawContent.slice(0, 500)` (the raw markdown string) to the UI.
- Symptom: Settings Agent replies occasionally started with ` ```json { "reply": "..." } ``` ` as literal visible text. Reproduced consistently from the Settings page; not reproduced from the feed.
- Fix: switched to `rawContent.match(/\{[\s\S]*\}/)` regex extraction before parsing — same approach already used by the inbox agent. The `catch` fallback also now strips fences before returning plain text.
- `inbox-agent/route.ts` catch fallback hardened in the same way for consistency (the regex path was already correct, but the catch returned raw text).
- Adversarial stress test: 13 cases covering fenced JSON, plain fences, mixed-case fences, preamble before JSON, Unicode content, non-JSON fallback, injection in reply content, and plan-gated feature questions — all pass.
- Documentation: new "JSON Response Parsing — Fence Stripping (P1)" subsection added to Security Model.

---

### Session 11 — April 2026 (System tab redesign)

**System tab layout overhauled (`app/settings/page.tsx`)**
- Removed `SystemStatusSection` entirely — the scanner/LinkedIn/digest status cards were hardcoded, non-actionable, and showed incorrect timing ("7 AM PST")
- Added `SystemIntegrationCards`: two compact side-by-side hero cards (Slack Digest + CRM Integration) rendered at the top of the System tab
  - Locked plans: shows plan gate badge (Pro+ / Agency) and upgrade CTA
  - Unlocked + connected: green dot, channel name or CRM name, "configure below" nudge
  - Unlocked + not connected: amber dot, setup nudge, "configure below" nudge
- `SlackIntegrationSection` locked gate changed from inline locked card → `return null` (overview card handles that UX)
- `CRMIntegrationSection` locked gate changed from inline locked card → `return null`
- Fixed `buildSettingsOpening()` system tab timing bug: "6 AM" → "~8 AM Pacific (3 PM UTC)" in both connected and disconnected branches

**Design rationale**
- The integration cards are now the first thing a user sees on the System tab — they drive plan upgrades for Trial/Starter users and surface connection status for Pro/Agency users without requiring a scroll
- Removing the status widget eliminated confusing hardcoded copy that never reflected real state

---

### Session 10 — April 2026 (Slack app display name update)

**Slack app renamed in Slack API dashboard**
- Display name updated from "ClientBloom Listener" → "Scout by ClientBloom" via api.slack.com → Basic Information → Display Information
- No code changes, no deploy — cosmetic change only; webhook URL and bot token unaffected
- Added "Slack app display name" section to docs/scout-agent.md for future maintainer reference

---

### Session 8 — April 2026 (Settings Agent + ICP Pool UX + Duplicate Bug Fix)

**Settings Agent launched**
- New `SettingsAgentPanel` component added to `app/settings/page.tsx` — floating violet button (bottom-right), 480px panel, same visual language as inbox agent
- New `/api/settings-agent/route.ts` — advisory-only AI endpoint (no action execution), Claude Haiku, maxDuration: 30
- Proactive opening message generated client-side via `buildSettingsOpening()` — tab-aware, personalised to user's setup state
- Context fetched on open via parallel `Promise.all`: `/api/business-profile`, `/api/linkedin-icps`, `/api/slack-settings`
- Stale-state guard: `active` closure flag prevents state updates if panel closes while fetches are in-flight
- "New conversation" reuses cached context + regenerates opening (no re-fetch)

**ICP Pool info box rewritten (`app/settings/page.tsx`)**
- New two-column card: left column explains Add Profile (all plans), right column explains Discover ICPs (Starter+)
- Top section explicitly states "any public LinkedIn profile" — removes the implicit assumption that ICPs must be existing contacts
- Trial tier footer shows pool/scan limits + upgrade tier comparison in a single line

**Duplicate Discover ICPs bug fixed (`app/settings/page.tsx`)**
- Root cause: partial refactor left a second 194-line copy of ICP interaction controls below the profile list, sharing the same `showAdd`/`showDiscover` state — clicking the locked Trial button in the first copy opened the ungated discovery panel in the second copy
- Fix: entire duplicate block removed; the correct first implementation retained
- "3 scanned per run" stale copy updated to "5 scanned per run" (matching `lib/tier.ts` scanSlots)

**Adversarial issues resolved**
- Stale-state after panel close (active closure flag)
- "New" button regression: ctx reset caused loss of proactive opener logic — fixed to reuse cached ctx
- Context fetch error path: silent fallback to generic opening message, panel remains fully functional
- Message sent before context loads: `effectiveCtx` fallback used (never sends `null` context to server)

---

### Session 6 — April 2026 (Bulk Selection Mode UX Overhaul + Documentation)

**Bulk selection mode rebuilt (app/page.tsx)**
- Removed "All" tab (`ActionFilter` type simplified; `filter !== 'all'` guard removed from post removal logic)
- Tab bar now transforms in-place on Select: tab strip conditionally replaced by tri-state select-all checkbox + selected count + status message + Cancel/Refresh — same container, no layout shift
- Select button moved to the tab bar right side with a checkbox icon affordance; only visible when posts exist
- Absolute-positioned checkbox (`absolute top-4 left-4 z-10`) removed; replaced with a proper flex left-column (`shrink-0`) on each post card article element — score badge no longer overlapped
- Momentum Widget collapses to `max-h-0 opacity-0` when selection mode is active (smooth CSS max-height transition)
- Scout Agent button fades out (`opacity-0 pointer-events-none scale-90`) during selection mode; panel closes automatically via `useEffect([selectionMode])`
- Bottom action bar: `fixed bottom-0` full-width transparent outer container (`pointer-events-none`) + centered pill (`pointer-events-auto`) — slides up via `translate-y-0 opacity-100` when ≥1 post selected
- Skip N / Archive N on non-Skipped tabs; Restore N on Skipped tab; action pill hides when selection clears
- `main` padding-bottom increases to `pb-28` during active selection to prevent action bar from obscuring last post

**Bug fixes**
- BUG-1: `bulkResult` success message was invisible — `setBulkLoading(false)` now fires before the 1.5s propagation wait, so `{bulkResult && !bulkLoading}` condition passes during the wait window
- BUG-2: Bottom action pill overlapped Scout Agent button on narrow viewports (~375px) — resolved by hiding Agent button entirely during selection mode rather than attempting z-index coordination
- BUG-3: Checkbox column vertical alignment at `sm:` breakpoint — added `sm:pt-6 sm:pl-5` to match the `sm:p-6` content padding

**Documentation**
- `docs/ux-design-system.md` updated with full "Bulk Selection Mode" section (flow, Scout Agent interaction, implementation notes, removed elements)
- `docs/scout-agent.md` updated with "Bulk Selection Mode Interaction" section (this session)
- `docs/README.md` updated with Design and UX section pointing to `ux-design-system.md`

---

### Session 5 — April 2026 (Scout Agent Button Redesign + Full Adversarial Validation)

**Problem solved**
The floating Scout Agent button was nearly invisible at rest (`bg-[#0d1017]` with a barely-visible slate border), causing it to blend into the dark UI chrome. Users could easily scroll past it without noticing it existed.

**Button redesign (`app/page.tsx`)**

| State | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Resting | Dark (`#0d1017`) + slate border — invisible | ClientBloom violet (`violet-600`) — always visible |
| Hover | Blue border tint + text brightens | Lightens to `violet-500`, scales up 5% |
| Open | Blue-600 | Darkens to `violet-700`, scales down (pressed feel) |
| Click feedback | None | `active:scale-95` tactile response |
| Shadow | `shadow-black/40` | `shadow-violet-600/40` — branded glow |

**Attention pulse (`agentPulse` state)**
- A `bg-violet-500 animate-ping` ring fires once on inbox load (via `useEffect([], [])`)
- Auto-stops after 5000ms via `clearTimeout` cleanup (no memory leak on unmount)
- Stops immediately if user opens the panel (`setAgentPulse(false)` in click handler)
- Ring is hidden while panel is open (`agentPulse && !agentOpen` condition)
- Ring has `pointer-events-none` so it cannot intercept button clicks
- Never repeats within a session — it's an onboarding nudge, not a recurring distraction

**Why bottom-right position was kept**
Bottom-right is the universal location for chat and AI assistant widgets (Intercom, Drift, Zendesk, Crisp, etc.). Users are trained to look there. The discovery problem was the button's invisible appearance, not its position. Moving it "front and center" would have conflicted with feed header controls and broken UX conventions.

**Adversarial & reliability test results — 53/53 passing**

All pre-existing security scenarios retained, plus new categories:

| Category | Scenarios | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| C1 Action type whitelist | 6 | ✅ All pass |
| C2 Score clamping | 9 | ✅ All pass |
| H1 currentAction whitelist | 9 | ✅ All pass |
| C5 Force confirm | 5 | ✅ All pass |
| B2 History sanitization | 5 | ✅ All pass |
| E1 Message length | 3 | ✅ All pass |
| B1 Post text framing | 3 | ✅ All pass |
| A1 Partial context detection | 3 | ✅ All pass |
| Plan injection labels | 6 | ✅ All pass |
| Button pulse state logic | 4 | ✅ All pass |
| **Total** | **53** | **53/53 ✅** |

**UI logic audit — 5/5 checks passing**
- `useEffect` returns `clearTimeout` cleanup (no memory leak on unmount)
- Empty dependency array — pulse fires exactly once on mount
- Ring condition `agentPulse && !agentOpen` correctly hides when panel is open
- Ping ring has `pointer-events-none` — cannot absorb clicks
- Click handler calls `setAgentPulse(false)` before toggling panel

---

### Session 4 — April 2026 (Plan-Aware Guidance + Upsell Rules)

**Plan injection**
- Added `plan` prop to `ScoutAgentPanel` in `page.tsx`; passed from `FeedPage` session JWT
- `plan` included in context payload sent to `/api/inbox-agent` on every turn
- Backend accepts `plan` in context type; runs it through `PLAN_LABELS` map to produce human-readable label with price (e.g. `'Scout Pro'` → `'Scout Pro ($99/mo)'`)
- `USER PLAN: <label>` pinned as the first line of every `contextBlock`, above all inbox state and post data
- System prompt header updated to tell the agent the plan will always be present and to use it

**New behavioral rules (Section 3)**
- Rule 13 — PLAN-AWARE ANSWERS: every feature/limit answer must reference the user's actual plan by name
- Rule 14 — UPGRADE SUGGESTIONS: when a user asks about a locked feature or hits a limit, name the unlocking plan + price + specific gains + how to upgrade
- Rule 15 — NO UNSOLICITED UPSELLS: upgrade suggestions only when genuinely warranted

**`max_tokens` increase**
- Bumped from 512 to 800 to support longer platform Q&A and upgrade explanation replies

---

### Session 3 — April 2026 (Platform Knowledge Base + Hallucination Guardrail)

**System prompt restructure**
- Split into three labeled sections (Role & Actions / Knowledge Base / Behavioral Rules) with inline editing guide
- Section 2 added: full platform knowledge base covering all plans, pricing, feature limits by tier, scans, scoring, inbox tabs, comment credits, all settings, Discover ICPs, Slack digest, team seats, billing flows, trial details, and support contact

**Hallucination guardrail**
- Rule 12 added: unknown questions → honest "I'm not sure" + direct to support at info@clientbloom.ai

**`max_tokens` increase**
- Bumped from 512 to 800 (subsequently to support platform Q&A)

---

### Session 2 — April 2026 (Security Hardening + UX Reset)

**New Conversation button**
- Added "↺ New" button to ScoutAgentPanel header (visible only when conversation history exists)
- Clears messages, pending action, pending reply, exec result, and loading state

**Security hardening — 45/45 adversarial scenarios passing**

| Fix | Code | What it closes |
|-----|------|---------------|
| Action type whitelist | C1 | Unknown/injected action types replaced with `none` |
| Score clamping | C2 | `maxScore`/`minScore` clamped to int [0,10]; non-finite → `undefined` |
| Filter enforcement | C4 | Bulk actions require filter; safe defaults applied |
| Force confirm | C5 | `bulk_skip`/`bulk_archive` always `confirm:true` server-side |
| Field fallbacks | F4 | `reply` and `summary` always guaranteed non-empty strings |
| Formula injection | H1 | `currentAction` whitelisted in agent output + bulk route Airtable formula |
| Prompt injection | B1 | Post text wrapped in `[USER POST CONTENT]` delimiters; Rule 10 added |
| Partial context | A1 | `NOTE:` injected when loaded posts < inboxCount |
| History validation | B2 | Role enum enforced; content truncated at 2000 chars; invalid entries dropped |
| Message length | E1/E2 | Client-side 1000-char guard + server-side 400 |
| Panel on tab switch | G3 | Agent panel closes automatically on tab switch |

**`posts/bulk/route.ts`**
- `currentAction` whitelisted before Airtable formula interpolation (H1 server layer)
- `maxScore` clamped server-side inside `fetchMatchingIds` (C2 server layer)

---

### Session 1 — April 2026 (Initial Build)

- `ScoutAgentPanel` component built in `page.tsx` — floating chat UI, pending action confirmation, execResult display
- `POST /api/inbox-agent` route created — Claude Haiku integration, JSON output, regex JSON extraction fallback
- `POST /api/posts/bulk` route created — bulk skip/archive/restore with explicit IDs or filter mode, chunked at 10/batch
- Airtable propagation delay (1500ms) added to `handleBulkAction` to prevent stale meta-query reads
- Selection state reset on tab switch via `useEffect([filter])`
- Scan breakdown display scoped to Inbox tab only
- `handleBulkAction` changed to `Promise<number>` — throws on failure, returns affected count
- Dedup fix in `lib/scan.ts` — skipped posts permanently included in `getExistingPostUrls()` OR formula
- `docs/scout-agent.md` created

---

## Known Limitations

**Partial score distribution.** The agent's view of score distribution reflects only the posts currently loaded in the UI (up to 100). Bulk actions always execute against the full dataset.

**No post content search.** The agent can only act on score thresholds and action states — it cannot search post text or filter by keyword.

**Single-turn filter execution.** One action per turn.

**No undo for archive.** Archived posts cannot be recovered via the agent. Skipped posts can be restored via `bulk_restore`.

**Knowledge base is static.** The agent's platform knowledge is baked into the system prompt at deploy time. It does not query live account data — it cannot answer "how many posts do I have this month" beyond what the inbox context provides.

**Plan from session JWT only.** The `plan` field comes from the NextAuth JWT, which is refreshed at sign-in and via `/api/session/refresh`. If a user upgrades mid-session without refreshing, the agent will show their pre-upgrade plan until the session updates. This is the same behavior as the rest of the UI.

---

## Future Development Notes

**Streaming replies.** Currently the agent waits for the full Haiku response. Streaming (`stream: true`) would improve perceived latency.

**Full-context mode.** Loading all post IDs and score distributions server-side during the agent request would give the model a complete picture of the inbox.

**Persistent conversation history.** History could be stored server-side (Redis + session token) to survive panel close/reopen.

**Rate limiting.** No per-tenant rate limit on the inbox-agent route. Add a sliding window before GA launch.

**Knowledge base sync automation.** Consider auto-generating Section 2 from `lib/tier.ts` at build time to keep plan limits in sync automatically without manual dual-maintenance.

**Evals.** A test suite of common scenarios (inbox management, platform Q&A, unknown question fallback, upgrade suggestion accuracy) would catch regressions on system prompt changes.
